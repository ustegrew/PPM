# PPM

A Peak Programme Meter.

Retrieves a stream of metering data from a stream of audio data. Sends the
meter stream to end points of various types. The metering stream follows the ballistics of a
classic BBC PPM meter.

Includes a primitive GUI to show the metering information.

Requires a running instance of [JackD](http://www.jackaudio.org).

The prototype for this program is being developed in Java. Head over to the
[repository](https://github.com/ustegrew/ppm-java). It is planned to port the 
program from Java to C++/Qt.
