# PPM

A Peak Programme Meter.

Retrieves a stream of metering data from a stream of audio data. Sends the
meter stream to end points of various types. The metering stream follows the ballistics of a
classic BBC PPM meter.

Includes a primitive GUI to show the metering information.

Requires a running instance of [JackD](http://www.jackaudio.org).
